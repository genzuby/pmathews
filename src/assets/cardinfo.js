      "I am a tenured Professor of English Literature in the Department of English Language and Literature at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea. Prior to this I was a Lecturer at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln (2002-03), a Visiting Assistant Professor at Creighton University (2003-05), and an Assistant Professor at Centenary College (now Centenary University) (2005-10). I have also served as the Secretary of the American Association of Australasian Literary Studies (AAALS).<br/><br/><br/><strong>RESEARCH</strong><br/><br/>My research focuses mainly on modern British fiction, Australian literature, and critical theory. I am particularly interested in how the genre of the novel has reshaped our ideas about ethics, empiricism, and subjectivity. I have published numerous academic articles and book chapters exploring this central idea and other related topics.<br/><br/>My first book, <i>Lacan the Charlatan</i>, examines ideas about mastery and authority as they appear in the work of Jacques Lacan, the famous French psychoanalyst. It is forthcoming in the Palgrave Lacan Series in 2020.<br/><br/>My current book project, provisionally titled <i>Magic and Madness</i>, is an in-depth examination of Susanna Clarke's landmark text Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. In that novel, magic is used as a symbol of what Michel Foucault calls 'unreason' (déraison), a critical mirror of the contradictions of human rationality. Examining this interplay of reason and unreason, <i>Magic and Madness</i> reveals the nuances of Clarke’s searing critique of the paradoxes of the modern, utilitarian world.<br/><br/><br/><strong>PHD DISSERTATION</strong><br/><br/>I completed my Ph.D. at Monash University, one of Australia's premier research universities, in 2002. My dissertation looked at postmodern literary theory's complex relationship with nineteenth-century realist fiction."

      "<i>Lacan the Charlatan</i> was inspired by a comment made by Noam Chomsky, who stated in an interview in 1989 that Jacques Lacan was a “charlatan” – not that Lacan’s ideas were flawed or wrong, but that his entire discourse was fraudulent. Since Chomsky made that claim, the accusation has been repeated by many other critics. This book sets out to determine the validity of that charge.<br/><br/>Examining the arguments of key anti-Lacanian critics, this book aims to weigh and contextualize the legitimacy of Lacan’s engagements with structural linguistics, mathematical formalization, science, ethics, Hegelian dialectics, and psychoanalysis. The guiding thread is Lacan’s own recurrent interrogation of authority, which inhabits an ambiguous zone between mastery and charlatanry.<br/><br/>Forthcoming in 2020 in the Palgrave Lacan Series<br/><br/>Click <Strong><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Lacan-Charlatan-Palgrave-Peter-Mathews/dp/3030452034/' target='_blank'>here</a></Strong> to buy from Amazon."
