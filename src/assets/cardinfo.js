      "Lacan the Charlatan was inspired by a comment made by Noam Chomsky, who stated in an interview in 1989 that Jacques Lacan was a “charlatan” – not that Lacan’s ideas were flawed or wrong, but that his entire discourse was fraudulent. Since Chomsky made that claim, the accusation has been repeated by many other critics. This book sets out to determine the validity of that charge.<br/><br/>Examining the arguments of key anti-Lacanian critics, this book aims to weigh and contextualize the legitimacy of Lacan’s engagements with structural linguistics, mathematical formalization, science, ethics, Hegelian dialectics, and psychoanalysis. The guiding thread is Lacan’s own recurrent interrogation of authority, which inhabits an ambiguous zone between mastery and charlatanry.<br/><br/>Forthcoming in 2020 in the Palgrave Lacan Series"
