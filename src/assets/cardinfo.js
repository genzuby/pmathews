          "I am a tenured Professor of English Literature in the Department of English Language and Literature at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea. I completed a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies at Monash University in 2002. I then worked for nearly a decade as an academic in the United States, before moving to Seoul in 2010.<br/><br/><br/>My research focuses mainly on modern British fiction, Australian literature, and critical theory. I am particularly interested in how the genre of the novel has reshaped our ideas about ethics, empiricism, and subjectivity.<br/><br/>I am the author of three academic books: <i>Lacan the Charlatan</i> (Palgrave, 2020), <i>English Magic and Imperial Madness: The Anti-Colonial Politics of Susanna Clarke's</i> Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (McFarland, forthcoming 2021), and <i>From Poet to Novelist: The Orphic Journey of John A. Scott</i> (Cambria, forthcoming 2022).",

          'John A. Scott began his literary life as a poet, but a writing fellowship in Paris persuaded him to turn to novels instead. The move was a success, with Scott’s fiction winning the Victorian Premier’s Literary Award and being shortlisted twice for the Miles Franklin Award. Scott’s work is not easy to read, however, and this book aims to illuminate his texts by guiding the reader through some of the key influences that have informed his Orphic journey from poet to novelist.<br/><br/>Forthcoming from Cambria Press in the Cambria Australian Literature Series.',

          'After disappearing for centuries, magic returns unexpectedly to Regency England in Susanna Clarke’s fantasy novel Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (2004). This inaugural study of Clarke’s groundbreaking work locates the consequences of this eruption of magical unreason in the context of England’s imperial history. Examining Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell in the larger historical context of magic and its links to colonialism, English Magic and Imperial Madness challenges its readers to rethink the connections between national identity, rationality, and power.<br/><br/>Forthcoming from McFarland Books in the Critical Explorations in Science Fiction and Fantasy Series.',

          "<i>Lacan the Charlatan</i> was inspired by a comment made by Noam Chomsky, who stated in an interview in 1989 that Jacques Lacan was a “charlatan” – not that Lacan’s ideas were flawed or wrong, but that his entire discourse was fraudulent. Since Chomsky made that claim, the accusation has been repeated by many other critics. This book sets out to determine the validity of that charge.<br/><br/>Examining the arguments of key anti-Lacanian critics, this book aims to weigh and contextualize the legitimacy of Lacan’s engagements with structural linguistics, mathematical formalization, science, ethics, Hegelian dialectics, and psychoanalysis. The guiding thread is Lacan’s own recurrent interrogation of authority, which inhabits an ambiguous zone between mastery and charlatanry.<br/><br/>Published in 2020 in the Palgrave Lacan Series<br/><br/>Click <Strong><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Lacan-Charlatan-Palgrave-Peter-Mathews/dp/3030452034/' target='_blank'>here</a></Strong> to buy from Amazon.",
