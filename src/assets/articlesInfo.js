          "This article examines the idea of an embodied art in A.S. Byatt’s short story ‘Body Art’. In order to contextualize this concept, the essay begins with a survey of Byatt’s earlier explorations of the link between mind and body, as well as an analysis of the small amount of secondary material relating to ‘Body Art’, a text that has received little critical attention. The article then explores the story’s ties to Dutch vanitas painting, a tradition that is intimately linked to the study of anatomy. The vanitas tradition shows how medicine and art were once a unified field, and explores the consequences of their modern division. This leads to a consideration of the influence of theological debates about mind and body and their effect, in particular, on Renaissance humanist art. The next section examines the shifting meaning of the archival collection, particularly in its significance for modern formations of subjectivity. This idea is particularly important in the context of the story’s allusions to Joseph Beuys, who views the artist’s body as a locus of creativity. Like Beuys, Byatt is interested in art that draws on the imaginative power of religious storytelling and imagery while rejecting its supernatural elements. Byatt draws together all of these elements in her story in order to articulate her vision of an embodied art, one that draws together the conceptual and the physical.<br/><br/>Journal: English: Journal of the English Association<br/>Issue: 68.263<br/>Publisher: Oxford University Press<br/>Year: 2019<br/>ISSN: 0013-8215"

          "This article explores the ethical concept of the neighbour, an idea central to the fiction of Tim Winton. The first part focuses on how the ghosts in Cloudstreet symbolize an Australian culture haunted by the injustices of colonization, especially the dispossession of the Indigenous people. The second part looks at the paradox of being commanded to love one’s neighbour, comparing an early story, ‘Neighbours’, to Winton’s recent novel Eyrie. The third part looks at Winton’s ethics of neighbourliness in light of recent critical reworkings of this concept by Slavoj Žižek and Kenneth Reinhard. Central to this section is the importance of time and place to the ethics of the neighbour, in particular the repeated insistence by both Winton and his critics that, rather than focusing on the past, we should acknowledge the neighbour who stands before us in the here and now.<br/><br/>Journal: Journal of Postcolonial Writing<br/>Issue: 55.5<br/>Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br/>Year: 2019<br/>ISSN: 1744-9855"

          "In order to understand A.S. Byatt’s short story ‘A Lamia in the Cévennes,’ from her collection Elementals: Stories of Fire and Ice (1998), it is necessary to understand the principle of dynamic tension that she employs in her work. As such, the initial part of this paper examines how Byatt engages in a constant process of critical examination using examples that prove pertinent to the story, such as her critique of D.H. Lawrence’s cosmological dichotomies of sun (masculine) and moon (feminine), her playful subversion of gender and sexuality in Possession, the deconstruction of postmodern theory in The Biographer’s Tale, and her fascination with retelling and subverting the myth of Melusine. The second part of the paper analyzes how these dynamic tensions manifest themselves in the story in question, from Byatt’s critique of Keats’s romanticism, to her subversion of the line between myth and reality, her examination of artistic realism and abstraction through the story’s references to David Hockney, and her reframing of all these questions in terms of problematic cultural assumptions about gender and sexuality. Altogether, these examples demonstrate the critical mindset at work in Byatt’s fiction, which never flinches from confronting the complexities that necessarily co-exist in life and art.<br/><br/>Journal: Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction Issue: 59.2<br/>Publisher: Taylor & Francis<br/>Year: 2018<br/>ISSN: 0011-1619"

          "This paper examines what Agamben calls the ‘destruction of experience’ – the downgrading of lived experience as truth in favor of empirical knowledge in the modern world – as it manifests itself in Kazuo Ishiguro’s short story ‘Cellists,’ the final piece in his collection Nocturnes (2009). The first half of the paper examines how the narrative situates Tibor, the story’s main character, within a complex set of symbols that reflect on the question of experience and repetition. Through the theoretical angle supplied by Agamben, I look at how the diminished status of lived experience in ‘Cellists’ repeats familiar patterns from Ishiguro’s other fiction, in particular his use of unreliable narrators and the ruthless utilitarianism of many of his American characters. The second half of the paper contemplates how this attitude produces a mood of disillusionment that is drawn, in particular, from the story’s setting in the Caffè Florian in Venice, with Ishiguro borrowing this sentiment from a long tradition that includes Henry James’s The Aspern Papers, Honoré de Balzac’s Massimilla Doni, and Thomas Mann’s short story ‘Disillusionment.’ By examining Ishiguro’s short story in the context of these three texts, the paper looks at how Florian’s has functioned repeatedly in the literary imagination as a site of reflection on the nature of experience and disillusionment.<br/><br/>Journal: Caesura: Journal of Philological and Humanistic Studies<br/>Issue: 4.2<br/>Publisher: Emanuel University Press<br/>Year: 2017<br/>ISSN: 2360-3372"

          "This essay emerged from the intersection of two texts: a 2009 article by Alistair Cormack claiming that Atonement was a rejection of postmodernism in favor of a return to F.R. Leavis’s Great Tradition, and the protagonist Briony’s closing question: ‘What are novelists for?’ This essay criticizes the ongoing legacy of Leavis’s association of literature and moral improvement, an argument still being recycled today by critics like Harold Bloom and Martha Nussbaum, by tracing McEwan’s long history of interrogating this presumed ethical link in his fiction. Far from affirming Leavis’s position, McEwan’s work shows that some of humanity’s worst atrocities have coincided with its greatest period of education and literacy. Rather than a moral phenomenon, the concluding section of the essay draws on the recent work of Nancy Armstrong, among others, to argue that the novel reflects the production of a peculiarly modern form of subjectivity that allows Atonement, by combining postmodern strategies with references to seminal texts from the British tradition (Richardson, Fielding, Burney, Austen, Woolf), to reveal the obscured roots of what gave birth to the novel in the first place.<br/><br/>Journal: Atlantis: Journal of the Spanish Association for Anglo-American Studies<br/>Issue: 39.2<br/>Publisher: Asociación Española de Estudios Anglo-Norteamericanos (Spanish Association for Anglo-American Studies)<br/>Year: 2017<br/>ISSN: 0210-6124"

Considering these two texts as companion pieces, this article sets out to unravel Byatt’s metaphor of the text as a fabric woven together from heterogeneous threads, first by setting this concept in the context of Roland Barthes’s theories about textuality, then by tracing how ‘Racine and the Tablecloth’ is itself spun from a multiplicity of sources and ideas that exist in dynamic tension: Byatt’s own experiences, Euripides, Ovid, and of course, Racine.<br/><br/>Journal: Contemporary Women’s Writing<br/>Issue: 11.2<br/>Publisher: Oxford University Press<br/>Year: 2017<br/>ISSN: 1754-1484"

          "The psychology of guilt as debt is a recurrent theme in Tim Winton’s fiction. A number of scholars have recently examined the theme of haunting in Winton’s Cloudstreet (1991), arguing that the ghosts which appear in the story represent an engagement with Australia’s colonial past, in particular the mistreatment of its Indigenous peoples. The latest of these, Michael R. Griffiths, highlights the shortcomings of Winton’s treatment of this theme, contending that Winton’s text might be read as a kind of excuse, in the name of naïveté, for colonial abuses. Given that Nicholas Birns (among others) has noted a new maturity in Winton’s work from The Turning (2004) onward, a fresh examination of such themes in Winton’s work is warranted. This essay does so through a reading of the short story ‘Aquifer’. Examining the story’s treatment of the psychology of guilt and debt, the essay explores how Winton tries to resolve the moral and historical problems he raises in regard to Australian culture through the ethical figure of the neighbour, drawn in particular from the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan. By showing the centrality of the neighbour to Winton’s work through references to In the Winter Dark (1988), Cloudstreet, Breath (2009), ‘Aquifer,’ and a newspaper editorial by Winton on the humanitarian treatment of refugees, this paper seeks to provide a new critical window through which to understand his evolving ethical ideas about Australia’s past and future.<br/><br/>Journal: Australian Literary Studies<br/>Issue: 32.1<br/>Publisher: Australian Literary Studies, Inc.<br/>Year: 2017<br/>ISSN: 1837-6479"

          "Pairing together the Coen brothers film A Serious Man (2009) with the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, this paper looks at questions about morality, illusion, and the influence of Jewish thought on contemporary ethics. Beginning with a reading of Nietzsche that locates his discussion of the Jews within its proper historical context, it traces the beginnings of the ‘morality meme,’ the notion of a universal moral reward that, Nietzsche argues, arises during the Deuteronomist period of Jewish history. The second part of the paper looks at how A Serious Man also engages in an interrogation of this moralistic overcoding of the universe, with a particular emphasis on how these questions upset Larry Gopnik’s views of both science and religion. The essay then concludes with a look at the poisonous effects of the ‘morality meme,’ showing in particular how it has influenced the psychology of anti-Semitism. Rather than a rejection of Jewishness, the paper concludes that in A Serious Man the Coen brothers engage in a careful but loving criticism of their own culture that requires them to distance themselves from the problematic effects of its religious morality.<br/><br/>Journal: Cultura: International Journal of Philosophy of Culture and Axiology<br/>Issue: 11.1<br/>Publisher: Peter Lang<br/>Year: 2014<br/>ISSN: 1584-1057"

          "Peter Carey’s novel Parrot and Olivier in America (2009) juxtaposes its two main characters, as one might expect, along class lines. Olivier is a privileged aristocrat and Parrot a rather colorful commoner, a device that Carey uses to provide the reader with an alternating perspective on their lives and times. There are clear parallels between Olivier’s chosen task of documenting what life is like in post-Revolutionary America and the work of Alexis de Tocqueville, but the particular concerns of both characters are in a sense subsumed by a debate that, although it has almost disappeared from political discussions, has never really been resolved. This debate centers on whether democracy is truly an effective and ethical form of government. Democracy, after all, makes the rather large assumption that the people are capable not just of ruling, but ruling wisely. Carey thus asks the reader to ponder some searching questions. What happens to culture in a democratic society? Is democracy possible, or is the descent into mob rule inevitable? Is the power now exercised by the bourgeois really any more just than that of the class they displaced? Carey’s novel is a powerful meditation on the ambivalence of democracy, reframing the unresolved questions of the revolutionary era in such a way that we understand their continuing, hidden force in our lives today.<br/><br/>Journal: Australian Literary Studies<br/>Issue: 27.2<br/>Publisher: Australian Literary Studies, Inc.<br/>Year: 2012<br/>ISSN: 1837-6479"

This essay, by contrast, argues that The Dying Animal is Roth’s exploration of an existential ‘pornography of destruction,’ one that both encompasses and transcends the realm of the sexual in its fascination with witnessing the event of its own death.<br/><br/>Journal: Philip Roth Studies<br/>Issue: 3.1<br/>Publisher: Purdue University Press<br/>Year: 2007<br/>ISSN: 1547-3929"

Central to Godard’s exercise is the decision to cast Anna Karina, his wife at the time, as the lead actress. Godard repeatedly demonstrates that the cinematic image functions as an opaque screen, a ‘mandatory proxy,’ between actor and viewer that renders a truly authentic autobiography impossible.<br/><br/>Journal: Biography: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly<br/>Issue: 29.1<br/>Publisher: University of Hawai’i Press<br/>Year: 2006<br/>ISSN: 0162-4962"

Mr. Darcy’s reluctance to express himself comes from his aristocratic sense of himself, a mode of thinking that had been rendered increasingly obsolete by the changing social conditions of the eighteenth century. Thus, as Austen’s story unfolds, Mr. Darcy gradually learns that, if he is to wield power and win Elizabeth’s love, he must not only possess certain virtues, but also produce and inscribe them onto the world.<br/><br>Book: Pride and Prejudice: A Bicentennial Bricolage<br/>Editor: Caterina Colomba<br/>Publisher: Forum University Press<br/>Year: 2016<br/>ISBN: 9788884208330"

I examine, in particular, the way in which the reader is gradually fed clues that neither the unnamed protagonist, sentenced to the colonies for an elaborate forgery, nor his memoirs are what they seem to be. Indeed, by the end of the narrative, the reader ought to have serious doubts as to the authenticity of both – rather than having been written by their purported author, this memoir seems instead to be the work of the addressee, a woman looking to escape her tyrannical husband. The story thus functions not only as a forgery, but as a distraction, a ‘screen’ behind which one can hide from the gaze of the colonial master.<br/><br/>Book: Postcolonial Issues in Australian Literature<br/>Editor: Nathanael O’Reilly<br/>Publisher: Cambria Press<br/>Year: 2010<br/>ISBN: 9781604977110"
